            <strong>1917</strong>

            <strong>1932</strong>

            <strong>1917</strong>
             - In 1934 Ella's name was pulled in a weekly drawing at the Apollo and she won the opportunity to compete in Amateur Night.  Ella went to the theater that night planning to dance, but made the last minute decision to sing.
            he asked the band to play Hoagy Carmichael's "Judy," a song she knew well because Connee Boswell's rendition of it was among Tempie's favorites. Ella quickly quieted the audience, and by the song's end they were demanding an encore. She obliged and sang the flip side of the Boswell Sister's record, "The Object of My Affections." Despite the tough crowd, Ella was a major success, and Chick hired her to travel with the band for $12.50 a week.

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "The one radio voice that I listened to above others belonged to Ella Fitzgerald. There was a quality to her voice that fascinated me, and I'd sing along with her, trying to catch the subtle ways she shaded her voice, the casual yet clean way she sang the words."
